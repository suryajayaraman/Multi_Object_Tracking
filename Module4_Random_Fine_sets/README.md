## Module4 Random Finite Sets (RFS)

- Sets with finite but random number of elements with random sets
- Properties of sets very suitable for MOT modelling - invariant to order, no duplicate elements
- Distribution of Sets can be described by its MO-PDF (Multi object PDF)
- Convolution formula to find distribution of union of multiple sets 
- Bernoulli RFS, Poisson Point Process are RFS used commonly in MOT
